# OOPS in JavaScript

## 4 Pillars of Object Oriented Programming
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction

## Encapsulation
- Encapsulation is the process of hiding the internal details of an object and exposing only the necessary information.
- Encapsulation is achieved by using access modifiers like private, protected, and public.
- Private: Only the class can access the private members.
- Protected: Only the class and its subclasses can access the protected members.
- Public: Anyone can access the public members.

## Inheritance
- Inheritance is the process of creating a new class from an existing class.
- Inheritance allows us to reuse code and create a hierarchy of classes.
- The existing class is called the parent class, and the new class is called the child class.
- The child class inherits all the properties and methods of the parent class.
- The child class can also add new properties and methods or override the existing ones.

## Polymorphism
- Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms.
- Polymorphism allows us to write code that can work with objects of different types.
- Polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and method overloading.
- Method overriding is when a child class overrides a method of its parent class.
- Method overloading is when a class has multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.

## Abstraction
- Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts.
- Abstraction allows us to focus on the essential features of an object and ignore the irrelevant details.
- Abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.
- Abstract classes are classes that cannot be instantiated.
- Abstract classes can have both abstract and non-abstract methods.
- Abstract methods are methods that have no implementation in the abstract class.
- Interfaces are similar to abstract classes but they cannot have any implementation.
- Interfaces can only have abstract methods.
- Interfaces can be implemented by classes.
